# Basic data handling

This chapter covers the basics of data handling in R

## Creating Objects

Anything created in R is an object. Objects can be assigned values using the assignment operator ``` <-```:

```{r}
x <- "hello world" #assigns the words "hello world" to the object x
```

To see the value of an object, simply type its name and hit enter:

```{r}
x #print the value of x to the console
```

You can also explicitely tell R to print the value of the object:

```{r}
print(x) #print the value of x to the console
```

Note that because we assign characters in this case (as opposed to e.g., numeric values), we need to wrap the words in quotation marks, which must always come in pairs. Although RStudio automatically adds a pair of quotation marks (i.e., opening and closing marks) when you enter the opening marks it could be that you end up with a mismatch by accident (e.g., ```x <- "hello```). In this case, R will show you the continuation character “+”. The same could happen if you did not execute the full command by accident. The "+"" means that R is expecting more input. If this happens, either add the missing pair, or press ESCAPE to abort the expression and try again.

To change the value of an object, you can simply overwrite the previous value. For example, you could also assign a numeric value to "x"" to perform some basic operations: 

```{r}
x <- 2 #assigns the value of 2 to the object x
print(x)
x == 2  #checks whether the value of x is equal to 2
x != 3  #checks whether the value of x is NOT equal to 3
x < 3   #checks whether the value of x is less than 3
x > 3   #checks whether the value of x is greater than 3
```

Note that the name of the object is completely arbitrary. We could also define a second object "y", assign it a different value and use it to perform some basic mathematical operations:

```{r}
y <- 5 #assigns the value of 2 to the object x
x==y #checks whether the value of x to the value of y
x*y #multiplication of x and y
x+y #adds the values of x and y together
y^2+3*x #adds the value of y squared and 3x the value of x together
```


## Data Types

The most important types of data are:


Data type	 | Description	 
------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------
Numeric | Approximations of the real numbers,  $\large\mathbb{R}$ (e.g., milage a car gets (e.g., 23.6, 20.9)
Integer  | Whole numbers,  $\large\mathbb{Z}$ (e.g., number of sales (e.g., 7, 0, 120, 63)
Character | Text data (strings) (e.g., product names)
Factor  | Categorical data for classification (e.g., product groups)
Logical  | TRUE, FALSE
Date  | Date variables (e.g., sales dates: 21-06-2015, 06-21-15, 21-Jun-2015)

Variables can be converted from one type to another using the appropriate functions (e.g., ```as.numeric()```,```as.integer()```,```as.character()```, ```as.factor()```,```as.logical()```, ```as.Date```). For example, we could convert the object ```y``` to character as follows:

```{r}
y <- as.character(y)
print(y)
```

Notice how the value is in quotation marks since it is now of type character. 

Entering a vector of data into R can be done with the ``` c(x1,x2,..x_n)``` ("concatenate") command. In order to be able to use our vector (or any other variable) later on we want to assign it a name using the assignment operator ``` <-```. You can choose names arbitrarily. Just make sure they are descriptive and unique. Assigning the same name to two variables (e.g. vectors) will result in deletion of the first.  

```{r}
#Numeric:
top10.track.streams <- c(163608, 126687, 120480, 110022, 108630, 95639, 94690, 89011, 87869, 85599) # Comments are written after "#" 
# and are not evaluated when the code is run; they can be written directly after the code or in a separate line

#Character:
top10.artist.names <- c("Axwell /\\ Ingrosso", "Imagine Dragons", "J Balvin", "Robin Schulz", "Jonas Blue", "David Guetta", "French Montana", "Calvin Harris", "Liam Payne", "Lauv") # Characters have to be put in ""

#Factor variable with two categories:
top10.track.explicit <- c(0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0)
top10.track.explicit <- factor(top10.track.explicit, levels = c(0:1), labels = c("not explicit", "explicit"))

#Factor variable with more than two categories:
top10.artist.genre <- c("Dance","Alternative","Latino","Dance","Dance","Dance","Hip-Hop/Rap","Dance","Pop","Pop")
top10.artist.genre <- as.factor(top10.artist.genre)

#Date:
top.10.track.release.date <- as.Date(c("2017-05-24", "2017-06-23", "2017-07-03", "2017-06-30", "2017-05-05", "2017-06-09", "2017-07-14", "2017-06-16", "2017-05-18", "2017-05-19"))

#Logical
top10.track.explicit.1 <- c(FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE)  
```

[INTERACTIVE TASK: ENTER NEW VARIABLE AND ADD TO DATA.FRAME]

In order to "call" a vector we can now simply enter its name:

```{r}
top10.track.streams
```
```{r}
top.10.track.release.date
```

In order to check the type of a variable the ```class(x)``` command is used.

```{r}
class(top.10.track.release.date)
```

## Data Structures

Now let's create a table that contains the variables in columns and each observation in a row (like in SPSS or Excel). There are different data structures in R (e.g., Matrix, Vector, List, Array). In this course, we will mainly use <b>data frames</b>. 

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://github.com/IMSMWU/Teaching/raw/master/MRDA2017/Graphics/dataframe.JPG" alt="data types" height="320"></p>

Data frames are similar to matrices but are more flexible in the sense that they may contain different data types (e.g., numeric, character, etc.). In contrast, all values of vectors and matrices have to be of the same type (e.g. character). It is often more convenient to use characters instead of numbers (e.g. when indicating a persons sex: "F", "M" instead of 1 for female , 2 for male). Thus we would like to combine both numeric and character values while retaining the respective desired features. This is where "data frames" come into play. Data frames can have different types of data in each column. For example, we can combine the vectors created above in one data frame using ```data.frame(...)```. This creates a separate column for each vector, which is usually what we want (similar to SPSS or Excel).

```{r}
music.data <- data.frame(top10.track.streams, top10.artist.names, top10.track.explicit, top10.artist.genre, top.10.track.release.date, top10.track.explicit.1)

```

### Accessing data in data frames

When entering the name of a data frame, R returns the entire data frame: 

```{r}
music.data # Returns the entire data.frame
```

Hint: You may also use the ```View(x)```-function to view the data in a table format (like in SPSS or Excel), i.e. enter the command ```View(data)```. Note that you can achieve the same by clicking on the small table icon next to the data frame in the "Environment"-Window on the right in RStudio.

Sometime it is convenient to return only specific values instead of the entire data frame. There are a variety of ways to identify the elements of a dataframe. One easy way is to explicitely state, which rows and columns you wish to view. The general form of the command is ```data.frame[rows,columns]```. Here are some examples:  

```{r}
music.data[,2:4] # all rows and columns 2,3,4
music.data[,c("top10.artist.names", "top.10.track.release.date")] # all rows and columns "top10.artist.names"" and "top.10.track.release.date"
music.data[c(1:5),c("top10.artist.names", "top.10.track.release.date")] # rows 1 to 5 and columns "top10.artist.names"" and "top.10.track.release.date"
```

You may also create subsets of the data frame, e.g., using mathematical expressions:

```{r}
  music.data[top10.track.explicit=="explicit",] # show only tracks with explicit lyrics  
  music.data[top10.track.streams>100000,] # show only tracks with more than 100,000 streams  
  music.data[top10.artist.names=='Robin Schulz',] # returns all observations from artist "Robin Schulz"
  music.data[top10.track.explicit=="explicit",] # show only explicit tracks
```

The same can be achieved using the ```subset(...)```-function

```{r}
  subset(music.data,top10.track.explicit=="explicit") # selects subsets of observations in a dataframe
  music.data.dance <- subset(music.data,top10.artist.genre=="Dance") #creates a new data frame that only contains tracks from genre "Dance" 
  music.data.dance
  rm(music.data.dance) # removes an object from the workspace
```

You may also change the order of the variables in a data frame by using the ```order(...)```-function

```{r}
music.data[order(top10.artist.genre,-top10.track.streams),] # orders by genre (ascending) and streams (descending)
```

### Inspecting the content of a data frame
```{r}
head(music.data,3) # returns the first X rows (here, the first 3 rows)
tail(music.data,3) # returns the last X rows (here, thelast 3 rows)
names(music.data) # returns the names of the variables in the data frame
str(music.data) # returns the structure of the data frame
nrow(music.data) # returns the number of rows 
ncol(music.data) # returns the number of columns 
dim(music.data) # returns the dimensions of a data frame
ls(music.data) # list all objects associated with an object
```

### Append and delete variables to/from data frames

To call a certain column in a data frame, we may also use the ```$``` notation. For example, this returns all values associated with the variable "top10.track.streams":
  
```{r}
  music.data$top10.track.streams
```

Assume that you wanted to add an additional variable to the data frame. You may use the ```$``` notation to achieve this:

```{r}
music.data$log_streams <- log(music.data$top10.track.streams) # create new variable as the log of the number of streams 
music.data$obs.number <- 1:nrow(music.data) # create an ascending count variable to assign numbers to the observations 
head(music.data)
```

To delete a variable, you can simply create a ```subset``` of the full data frame that excludes the variables that you wish to drop:

```{r}
music.data <- subset(music.data,select = -c(log_streams)) # deletes the variable log streams 
head(music.data)
```

You can also rename variables in a data frame, e.g., using the ```rename()```-function from the ```plyr``` package:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("plyr")
```

```{r}
library(plyr)
music.data <- plyr::rename(music.data, c(top10.artist.genre="genre",top.10.track.release.date="release.date"))
head(music.data)
```
